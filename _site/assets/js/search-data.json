    "content": "UDISE can be configured in two ways: first, by following the bulk upload process, and second, by having API integration. API integration is not followed during MVP creation. But the process has been explained. | In the bulk upload process, during the first year, since it will be time-consuming to onboard all the schools by asking them to fill in their data, the state will need the option to bulk upload school information through the backend. Process flow - . a. A state or District person uploads a CSV or Excel file (a standard file with a predefined template for columns) . b. States can upload for all districts, and districts can upload for their district only. c. Once the file is uploaded, the system saves the school information, marks the account status as BULKUPLOAD and verifies it. d. In this process, there is the possibility that some schools that may be newly recognised are not available on the state’s list. For the next years, to include the new UDISE code in the RTE portal, we need to provide a panel in the Block admins login where the Block-level authority can submit some basic details to the schools by offline validating the schools. e. School information that the Block admin adds should be marked as INDIVIDUAL, which needs to be verified by the district admin, who is the higher authority. f. DEOs can verify the new school’s information by visiting the UDISE portal (from which schools will receive recognition and be assigned a UDISE code). g. Once the school’s UDISE code is added to the RTE database either by BULKUPLOAD or by INDIVIDUAL upload process and the status is verified, only the school can create an account to register for a particular campaigning year. | Another way schools can be onboarded for the campaigning year is through an API integration from the UDISE portal, which skips the UDISE configuration part. API integration will be explained in the school account creation section (School management module Point 1). | A panel should be where the Block admin can perform the CRUD operations on existing school information. For example, on a requirement basis, BEOs can change a school’s status from non-minority to Minority, from non-aided to aided, and the school’s active status to inactive and vice versa. | Regarding API integration, UDISE integration from the UDISE portal will happen once. Then, that particular UDISE will be disconnected from the API now if there is a change in the status of the school, which will be modified by the Block admin from the panel, which we will create in point 3. | Fields that are required: a. UDISE code (Numeric only, mandatory, fixed to 11 digits, Non-primary key) . b. School Name (alphabetic, mandatory) . c. District Code (Number only, can be of a minimum of 3 digit max can be up to 5 or 6) . d. Block ID/code (Number only, can be of a minimum of 3 digit max can be up to 5 or 6) . e. U/ R (Alphabetic, one digit which keeps U for urban and R for rural) . f. Minority (Y/N) (Boolen, 1 for Yes and 0 for No) . g. Aided (Y/N) (Boolen, 1 for Yes and 0 for No) . h. Active (Y/N) (Boolen, 1 for Yes and 0 for No) . | . Note: . | There should be a possibility that schools that do not have a recognition certificate are not alloted UDISE code until the school registration/renewal process is going on. In this situation, the school admin can try to enter an invalid (or temporary or wrong) UDISE code to benefit from this scheme. There is also the possibility that the school will not get the recognition certificate for any reason. However, with the wrong UDISE code, the school is registered and will get the wrong admission of students. So, to avoid this type of situation, this should be provided to the BEOs login, and there should be a declaration from the . | BEO that they have validated the schools. DEOs should also make the next level of verification. BEOs will offline inform the schools that they have been added and verified and that the schools can now create an account for the campaign. | The district admin should be responsible for verifying the Excel records offline. | The portal should not verify this because we are not following API integration through the UDISE portal. If the State follows API integration, there is no need for bulk or individual uploads. Also, the records will be directly verified from the External (UDISE) portal when the school account is created. | For schools that are non-minority, non-aided, active and verified by DEO, only those schools can be eligible for account creation, and only the list of these schools will be displayed on the dropdown list to create an account. | .
